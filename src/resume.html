                <p>
                Growing up in Ethiopia, I was always taught to believe in the power of purpose and helping others.
                The idiom "If you cry deep from your heart, tears can't be blocked" has stayed with me as
                a reminder to always strive for what I truly desire and never give up on my dreams. As a child,
                I was fascinated by the human body and aspired to become a surgeon. However, as I got older, my 
                interests shifted towards the field of technology. When it was time to apply for university, I 
                decided to follow my passion and pursue a degree in software engineering at Addis Ababa University 
                (AAU), the oldest and most prestigious university in Ethiopia. However, when I was assigned to the 
                software engineering department after completing the freshman course, I was faced with a new challenge. 
                I had no previous experience with programming or computer languages, and I wasn't sure if I was up for
                    the task. Despite the initial difficulty, I was determined to make the most out of my situation. 
                    I started taking courses in python programming, data structures, and algorithms. With each passing day,
                    I became more and more interested in software engineering, and I found myself drawn to the challenge
                    of solving complex programming problems. I realized that I had discovered a new passion, and I was
                    eager to develop my skills even further. One day, I came across a one-year industrial programming 
                    and service training program in Alabuga, Russia. I applied for the program, hoping that it would 
                    provide me with an opportunity to learn from experienced professionals and immerse myself in a new
                        culture. I was thrilled when I received my acceptance letter and knew that this was the next step 
                        in my journey. In Russia, I learned new programming language and discovered new ways of thinking
                        about software development. The experience was truly life-changing, and it only strengthened my 
                        passion towards my dream. Now, I am excited to apply to your esteemed program. I believe that this
                        is the next step in my journey, and I am eager to continue developing my skills and knowledge in
                        the field of software engineering. I am hungry for knowledge and passionate about using 
                        technology to improve lives. As a software developer, I believe that I can make a meaningful 
                        contribution to the world.    
                <blockquote cite="—W.J.Wilmont_Buxton">"No great work is ever done in a hurry. To develop a great scientific
                discovery, to print a great picture, to write an immortal poem, to
                become a minister, or a famous general—to do anything great requires
                time, patience, and perseverance. These things are done by degrees,
                “little by little.”"</blockquote>
                As per quote I am confident that I have the passion, drive, and skills necessary to succeed in your program and make a positive impact on the world.
